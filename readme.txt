Hello! 

My name is KuroRyder and this is my first ever full script! At least one not written for work lol.

Special thanks to my friend, Sev, who guided me through this and has been an absolute blessing in helping me learn Python.

In order to use this script you'll need to download and install python 3, which is super easy!

Download Link:
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you download and install Python 3, you can save the diceroller script to a folder or your desktop.

Double click to run and enter the dice rolls you are looking for.

Features include:
-roll dice of all types and faces.
-roll multiple dice at once
-add your modifiers specific to your characters
-roll a standard roll or with advantage or disadvantage
-show a history of your rolls

Script Example:
What are we rolling? Enter history if you want to view all past rolls.
3d10 (enter in this format - how many dice? d how many sides?)

Are there any modifiers?
Please use positive or negative integer.If none, enter zero.
-2 or 2 (do not use + for positive, only use - for negative intergers)

Are you rolling regularly (0) or with advantage (1) or disadvantage (2)?
0 (enter 0, 1, or 2 for this)

We are rolling 3 d10 dice   and a modifier of -2
Your roll total is 17

All feedback is welcome!! Feel free to email me suggestions at KuroRyderrr@gmail.com and any errors you come across. 


In time I will be working on making this a fully functioning webpage for easier access.

Thank you for your feedback and support!

-Kuro
